- Healthy men and women (n = 24)
- two weeks of unilateral limb immobilization
- muscle biopsies: before, after 48 hours (48 H) and 14 days (14 D) of immobilization
- results: *"Micro-array analyses of total RNA extracted from biopsy samples at 48 H and 14 D uncovered 575 and 3,128 probes, respectively, which were significantly altered during immobilization."*
