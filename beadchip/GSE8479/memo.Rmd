## Summary:
Overall design
A muscle biopsy was taken from the vastus lateralis muscle of the right or left leg (randomized)
before exercise or immobilization (young people, N = 26 total) and
before (N = 25), and after (N = 14), the training period in older adults,
~20 cm proximal to the knee joint using a 5mm Bergström biopsy needle.
The muscle was dissected of fat and connective tissue,
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C for subsequent analysis.
All subjects were required to abstain from strenuous physical activity
for 48 h prior to the muscle biopsy.

we found 596 genes differentially expressed using a false discovery rate cut-off of 5%.
(compared younger and older subjects)

### problems
**1. Normalization**  
The original study `limma` for normalization whereas our analysis used `normalizeIllumina()`. (`normalizeBetweenArrays()` didn't work) The outputs from both function seemed to be same. Suppose, there is no problems choosing `normalizeIllumina()` here.
