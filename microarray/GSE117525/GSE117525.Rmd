- GSM3302211 Training for both frail and healthy older subjects and consisted of  
progressive full‐body resistance‐type exercise training. However,  
the frail older group had training sessions twice per week,  
whereas the healthy older group trained three times per week.  
In addition, subjects took a protein or control drink for the duration of the study.  
The healthy older group received a 15g portion of milk protein or control supplement at breakfast.  
The frail older group received a similar drink containing 15g supplement drink (milk protein or control)  
at breakfast and lunch.
